        <h2 style="border: 2px solid black;">Shift Manager</h2>
        <p>I am a Shift Manager at a casual restaurant known as Noodles and Company. At age 18, I started working at Noodles and Company. Most kids who are still in high school desire to work, but I was reluctant to do so because I believed it would distract me from my studies. 
          After working at the restaurant for three months, I was offered the shift management position, which I accepted, because I saw it as an excellent opportunity to develop my leadership skills.</p>
